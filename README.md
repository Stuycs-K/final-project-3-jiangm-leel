## Project Description
This is a visualizer for Poem Code, a cryptography method used by the British Special Operations Executive to communicate amongst one another while in Nazi-occupied territories. Using Processing, you will be able to see step by step how this method encodes a secret message.

## Launch Code
* To select a message to encode and poem to encode with, edit the message.txt and poem.txt inside encode/data/. Make sure all the text is in the first line, with no leading whitespace and cleaned of any punctuation.
* Use 'a' and 'd' keys to toggle between steps for the encode visualizer.
* To decode, paste in the encoded message returned by the encode program into decode/data/cipher.txt.
